Estimote Beacons Xamarin SDK wrapper
=======================

A wrapper around the Estimote iOS SDK ( https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK ).

Estimote Beacons are small, wireless sensors from http://estimote.com that use a new Bluetooth low energy (BLE) chip and continually transmit radio signals that your phone can pick up.
You can think about the beacon as a small lighthouse tower that's installed in a fixed location and broadcasts its presence to all the ships (smartphones) around.
The nearby smartphones can communicate with them using an API theyâ€™ve developed to make it easy for developers to add micro-location features to their mobile apps.

it uses a new Bluetooth chip that relatively continuously transmits radio signals that your phone picks up and then you get hyper context specific alerts. And it uses almost no power!

For the technical specifications about the Estimote beacon see http://estimote.com/api/index.html


- **UPDATE** 2013-11-22 Created a working Proximity demo that uses the wrapper by translating the ProximityDemo from Estimote: https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK

- *NOTE* This is work in progress, a beta, no guarantees, **Everything may change!**
- *NOTE* This is my first encounter with Xamarin wrappers around Objective-C libraries. Therefore, code may need fixes, however ATM it's just a proof of concept.
- I will appreciate all input, feedback, and especially contributions!

This is my personal project, I'm not affiliated with Estimote in any way.
